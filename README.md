# Project Setup and Instructions

## Environment Variables

To set up the project, you'll need to define the following environment variable:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://dummyjson.com
```

Make sure to add this in your `.env` file to connect the app with the mock API.

## Login Credentials

You can use the following credentials to log in with different roles:

### Admin Role:

- **Username**: emilys
- **Password**: emilyspass

### User Role:

- **Username**: abigailr
- **Password**: abigailrpass

or

- **Username**: madisonc
- **Password**: madisoncpass

### Note:

Due to the use of a mock API, only limited operations are available, and some features may not be fully functional without a proper backend.
